# CS-MVC-IA
Client-Side MVC In Action Aka CS-MVC-IA, I will use Jquery,Backbone,Angular, Bootstrip in action in each branch.
just use:
git checkout action_xxx
to get each example.
and each branch has it ownself Readme.md to illustrate  what including in current branch.
<br/>
git checkout action_005

this branch is use Angular to do directive.

directive if name has UPPER character, then in the HTML,it should be add - before UPPER character.
for example in the js we defined the directive name is 
angularstudyClock
then in html, it should be angularstudy-Clock or angularstudy-clock
